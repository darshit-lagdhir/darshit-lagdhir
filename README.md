# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey, I’m Darshit<br><br>I’m a BCA student at Kristu Jayanti University, currently exploring almost every tech thing that catches my interest and makes sense to learn. I like understanding how systems work behind the scenes and building things that are practical, not just good-looking on paper.<br><br>I enjoy working on logic-heavy problems, backend systems, cloud infrastructure, APIs, and automation. I like experimenting with new tools, breaking things (sometimes unintentionally), and then figuring out how to fix them properly. Learning by doing is what works best for me.<br><br><br><br>Most of my interest is in backend and system-level work. I enjoy problem solving, working with data structures, and improving code so it runs better and feels more solid. I also like doing full-stack projects because it’s satisfying to see an idea turn into something real that you can actually use.<br><br>Things I enjoy working on<br>- Backend and system-level programming<br>- Data structures and logical problem solving<br>- Full-stack application development<br>- Cloud, APIs, and AI-based features<br>- Cleaning up code and making it easier to maintain<br><br>Tech I usually work with<br>- C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript<br>- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React<br>- MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL<br>- Git, GitHub, VS Code<br><br>Right now, I’m spending time improving my fundamentals, understanding cloud platforms, infrastructure automation, databases, and scalable systems. I enjoy mixing practical business problems with tech solutions, because that’s where things start to feel real.
<br><br>I believe good software should be simple, efficient, and easy to understand. Code doesn’t need to be fancy to be good. It just needs to work well and be readable. If it looks clean too, that’s a bonus.<br><br>Always learning, always building, and still sometimes surprised when a bug disappears after adding a print statement.
