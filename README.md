# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey, I’m Darshit<br><br>I’m a BCA student at Kristu Jayanti University. I like building software that actually works in real life, not just something that looks good for submissions.<br><br>I enjoy getting into the logic side of things. I like understanding how systems work behind the scenes, breaking problems into smaller parts, and writing code that still makes sense when I open it again after a long time. I try to keep things clean and simple instead of adding unnecessary complexity.<br><br>Most of my interest is in backend and system-level work. I enjoy problem solving, working with data structures, and improving code so it runs better and feels more solid. I also like doing full-stack projects because it’s satisfying to see an idea turn into something real that you can actually use.<br><br>Things I enjoy working on<br>- Backend and system-level programming<br>- Data structures and logical problem solving<br>- Full-stack application development<br>- Cloud, APIs, and AI-based features<br>- Cleaning up code and making it easier to maintain<br><br>Tech I usually work with<br>- C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript<br>- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React<br>- MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL<br>- Git, GitHub, VS Code<br><br>Right now, I’m mainly focused on getting better at the fundamentals. I spend a lot of time building projects, trying things out, breaking stuff, fixing it, and then improving it again. I learn best by doing, not just by reading or memorizing things.<br>I believe good software should be simple, efficient, and easy to understand. Code doesn’t need to be fancy to be good. It just needs to work well and be readable. If it looks clean too, that’s a bonus.<br>Always learning, always building, and still sometimes surprised when a bug disappears after adding a print statement.
